## Bugs Fixed

### Bug #1: Tasks Not Persisting After Creation

**Location:** `src/hooks/useTasks.ts`

**Issue:**
The `addTask` function was updating the React state but not saving the new tasks to localStorage. When users created a task and refreshed the page, the task would disappear because it was never persisted to storage.

**Solution:**
Added `saveTasksToStorage(updatedTasks)` call after updating the state in the `addTask` function. Now when a task is created, it's both added to the state and saved to localStorage, ensuring persistence across page refreshes.

---

### Bug #2: Delete Task Not Working Correctly

**Location:** `src/hooks/useTasks.ts`

**Issue:**
The `deleteTask` function was using `splice()` to mutate the tasks array directly, but never called `setTasks()` to update the React state. This meant the task was deleted from localStorage but remained visible in the UI until a page refresh.

**Solution:**
Replaced the mutation-based approach with an immutable filter operation. Changed from `tasks.splice(taskIndex, 1)` to `tasks.filter((task) => task.id !== id)`, then properly called `setTasks(updatedTasks)` to trigger a re-render. This ensures both the UI and localStorage stay in sync.

---

### Bug #3: Missing Form Validation

**Location:** `src/components/TaskForm.tsx`

**Issue:**
Users could submit the task form with empty title or description fields. There was no client-side validation to prevent creating tasks without required information, leading to incomplete or invalid task data.

**Solution:**
Added `required` attributes to both the title input and description textarea. This leverages HTML5 form validation to prevent submission of empty fields and provides native browser validation feedback to users.

## Improvements Made

### Improvement #1: Case-Insensitive Search

**Location:** `src/components/TaskList.tsx`

**Details:**
Enhanced the search functionality to be case-insensitive, improving user experience by allowing users to find tasks regardless of capitalization. Previously, searching for "setup" would not find tasks with titles like "Setup development environment".

**Implementation:**
Made the search case-insensitive by converting both the search query and task title/description to lowercase before comparison. Now users can search with any case combination and still find matching tasks.

---

### Improvement #2: Date Formatting for Display

**Location:** `src/components/TaskCard.tsx`

**Details:**
Improved date display by formatting raw ISO date strings into human-readable, locale-aware dates. Previously, dates were shown as raw ISO strings (e.g., "2025-11-28"), which was not user-friendly.

**Implementation:**
Implemented proper date formatting using `new Date(dateString).toLocaleDateString()`. Now due dates are displayed in a user-friendly format based on the user's locale (e.g., "28/11/2025" in UK locale).

---

### Improvement #3: Memoized Callbacks

**Location:** `src/app/app.tsx`

**Details:**
Optimized component performance by memoizing callback functions passed as props. This prevents unnecessary re-renders and effect triggers in child components, improving overall application performance.

**Implementation:**
- Added `useCallback` import from React
- Created a memoized `handleSearchChange` callback using `useCallback` with an empty dependency array
- Updated TaskFilter component to use the memoized callback instead of the state setter directly

---

### Improvement #4: Improved ID Generation

**Location:** `src/hooks/useTasks.ts`

**Details:**
Enhanced ID generation to use `crypto.randomUUID()` instead of `Date.now().toString()` to prevent potential ID collisions when creating multiple tasks rapidly. This provides more robust unique identifier generation for local-only applications.

**Implementation:**
- Replaced `Date.now().toString()` with `crypto.randomUUID()` for task ID generation
- Added the comment to note that in production environments, IDs should be generated by the backend
- The new approach ensures unique IDs even when tasks are created in quick succession

---

## Features Implemented

### Feature #1: Helper Functions Integration

**Location:** `src/components/TaskList.tsx`

**Details:**
Integrated the existing `filterTasksByStatus` helper function from `taskHelpers.ts` into the TaskList component. This replaces the inline filtering logic and promotes code reusability while maintaining the same functionality.

**Implementation Approach:**
- Imported `filterTasksByStatus` from `taskHelpers.ts`
- Replaced the inline status filtering logic with a call to the helper function when filter is not 'all'
- Added a comment noting that the helper function also sorts by createdAt desc, but this is overridden by the component's custom sorting logic that runs after filtering

---

### Feature #2: Delete Confirmation Dialog

**Location:** `src/components/TaskCard.tsx`

**Details:**
Added a confirmation dialog before deleting tasks to prevent accidental data loss. Users are now prompted with a clear message including the task title before the deletion is executed.

**Implementation Approach:**
- Modified the `handleDelete` function to show a `window.confirm()` dialog
- The confirmation message includes the task title for clarity: "Are you sure you want to delete "[task title]"? This action cannot be undone."
- The delete operation only proceeds if the user confirms the action

---

### Feature #3: Tags Functionality

**Location:** `src/components/TaskForm.tsx`

**Details:**
Implemented full tag management functionality in the TaskForm component. Users can now add, view, and remove tags when creating or editing tasks. Tags are displayed in TaskCard components and persisted with task data.

**Implementation Approach:**
- Added state management for tags array and tag input field
- Created handler functions: `handleAddTag()` (prevents duplicates), `handleRemoveTag()`, and `handleTagInputKeyDown()` (Enter key support)
- Added UI section with tag input field, "Add" button, and display of existing tags with remove buttons
- Updated form submission to include the tags array instead of an empty array
- Tags are properly initialized from `initialTask` when editing and reset when form is cleared

---

### Feature #4: Accessibility Improvements

**Location:** Multiple components (`src/components/TaskCard.tsx`, `src/components/TaskFilter.tsx`, `src/components/TaskList.tsx`, `src/app/app.tsx`)

**Details:**
Comprehensive accessibility improvements across all components to enhance screen reader support and keyboard navigation, following WCAG guidelines.

**Implementation Approach:**
- **TaskCard**: Added `role="status"` and `aria-label` to priority/status badges; added descriptive `aria-label` attributes to action buttons
- **TaskFilter**: Added screen-reader-only label for search input; added `role="group"` and `aria-label` to filter button group; added `aria-pressed` to indicate active filter state
- **TaskList**: Added `role="group"` and `aria-label` to sort controls; added `aria-pressed` to sort buttons; added descriptive `aria-label` to all sort and toggle buttons
- **App**: Added `role="status"` and `aria-live="polite"` to loading message; added `role="region"` and `aria-label` to statistics dashboard; added `aria-label` and `aria-expanded` to main action button
