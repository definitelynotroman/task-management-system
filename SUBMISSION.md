## Bugs Fixed

### Bug #1: Tasks Not Persisting After Creation

**Location:** `src/hooks/useTasks.ts`

**Issue:**
The `addTask` function was updating the React state but not saving the new tasks to localStorage. When users created a task and refreshed the page, the task would disappear because it was never persisted to storage.

**Solution:**
Added `saveTasksToStorage(updatedTasks)` call after updating the state in the `addTask` function. Now when a task is created, it's both added to the state and saved to localStorage, ensuring persistence across page refreshes.

### Bug #2: Delete Task Not Working Correctly

**Location:** `src/hooks/useTasks.ts`

**Issue:**
The `deleteTask` function was using `splice()` to mutate the tasks array directly, but never called `setTasks()` to update the React state. This meant the task was deleted from localStorage but remained visible in the UI until a page refresh.

**Solution:**
Replaced the mutation-based approach with an immutable filter operation. Changed from `tasks.splice(taskIndex, 1)` to `tasks.filter((task) => task.id !== id)`, then properly called `setTasks(updatedTasks)` to trigger a re-render. This ensures both the UI and localStorage stay in sync.

### Bug #3: Case-Sensitive Search

**Location:** `src/components/TaskList.tsx`

**Issue:**
The search functionality was case-sensitive, meaning searching for "setup" would not find tasks with titles like "Setup development environment". This created a poor user experience where users had to match exact capitalization.

**Solution:**
Made the search case-insensitive by converting both the search query and task title/description to lowercase before comparison. Now users can search with any case combination and still find matching tasks.

### Bug #4: Due Date Not Formatted for Display

**Location:** `src/components/TaskCard.tsx`

**Issue:**
The `formatDate` function was returning raw ISO date strings (e.g., "2025-11-28") instead of human-readable dates. The function had a comment indicating it should format dates but was just returning the raw string.

**Solution:**
Implemented proper date formatting using `new Date(dateString).toLocaleDateString()`. Now due dates are displayed in a user-friendly format based on the user's locale (e.g., "28/11/2025" in UK locale).

---

### Bug #5: Missing Form Validation

**Location:** `src/components/TaskForm.tsx`

**Issue:**
Users could submit the task form with empty title or description fields. There was no client-side validation to prevent creating tasks without required information, leading to incomplete or invalid task data.

**Solution:**
Added `required` attributes to both the title input and description textarea. This leverages HTML5 form validation to prevent submission of empty fields and provides native browser validation feedback to users.

## Future Improvements

The following improvements have been identified for future implementation:

- **Memoize callbacks** (`src/components/TaskFilter.tsx`): Consider using `useCallback` in parent component (`app.tsx`) for `onSearchChange` callback to prevent unnecessary re-renders and effect triggers.

- **ID generation** (`src/hooks/useTasks.ts`): In production, IDs should be generated by the backend. For local-only apps, consider using `crypto.randomUUID()` instead of `Date.now()` to avoid potential ID collisions.
